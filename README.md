# Road Accident Analysis Excel Project

This repository contains an Excel project focused on analyzing road accidents. The project aims to provide insights and statistical analysis regarding road accidents based on available data.

## Data

Please download the [data.xlsx](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OW5LMNmsFeZJQugGfV7gGauKyxj26L6l/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101033190051376471690&rtpof=true&sd=true) file and place it in the root directory of this project before running any analysis.

## Analysis

The analysis consists of the following sections:

1. **Data Exploration**: Initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Preprocessing and cleaning of the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
3. **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculating descriptive statistics such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc., to gain insights into the data distribution.
4. **Visualization**: Visual representations of the data using charts, graphs, and tables to highlight trends and patterns.
5. **Correlation Analysis**: Exploring relationships between different variables to identify potential correlations.
6. **Predictive Modeling (if applicable)**: Building predictive models to forecast road accidents based on historical data.
7. **Conclusion**: Summary of findings and insights derived from the analysis.
